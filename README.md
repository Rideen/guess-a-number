# Guess a number

A React Native game which helps you learn React Native. It is incredibly simple and not meant to be played a lot (since it is no fun), but it showcases some of React Native features and how easy it is to implement them.

## Installation

Clone the repo and do 

```bash
npm install
```

Make sure you have Expo CLI installed on your machine: https://docs.expo.io/versions/v35.0.0/get-started/installation/

## Usage

In order to run the application use the following command:

```bash
expo start
```
